## setup env

install anconda and install tensorflow

https://margaretmz.medium.com/anaconda-jupyter-notebook-tensorflow-and-keras-b91f381405f8

## colab

you can also use google colab in which the tensorflow has been already installed.

## first ann

Part 8 - Deep Learning - Section 39

## cnn

Convolutional Neural Network

additional materials

input => feature detector => feature map

feature detector is a kernal / filter

feature map is a group of convolutional layers


pooling => able to recognize image distortion / rotation / different direction etc...


test and viz deep learning process

https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/flat.html


input => convolution layer => pooling layer => flattening => ann => output 


softmax function => output values add up to 1 and each value represent the probability of the classification

cross-entropy function 

Dog 0.9, Cat 0.1 => cross-entropy function => similar MSE


cross-entropy better for classification <== ??
